java plugin for Eclipse, to interact with Bitbucket's REST API. 

## Purpose
The main goal of this plugin is to propose an Eclipse View that displays all open Pull Requests in a treeview, by Project and by repository.
The plugin currently offers different levels of filtering:
 - Filter on BitBucket project
 - Filter on BitBucket repositories
 - Filter on Pull Request's title
 - Filter on Pull Request's source branch name
 - Filter on Pull Request's target branch name 

The plugin interacts with BitBucket using the BitBucket REST APIs.
